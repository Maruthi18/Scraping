The truth.&#34; Dumbledore sighed. &#34;It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.
I&#39;m the one that&#39;s got to die when it&#39;s time for me to die, so let me live my life the way I want to.
To die will be an awfully big adventure.
It takes courage to grow up and become who you really are.
But better to get hurt by the truth than comforted with a lie.
You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.
You have to write the book that wants to be written. And if the book will be too difficult for grown-ups, then you write it for children.
Never tell the truth to people who are not worthy of it.
A person&#39;s a person, no matter how small.
... a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge.
